            <span class="padded-dropcap">T</span>he police is an institution that we have made central to our societies. 
            We invest enormous amounts of money, time, and effort in its daily operation, in its enhancement, and in its reform; 
            we are deeply committed to sustaining it. Yet many of us spend little time thinking about what the police actually do. 
            This is especially true for those of us who are the most privileged, who don't interact with the police unless we want to. 
            Ideologically, our society is at ease with the police committing various forms of violence — surveillance, arrest, detainment, 
            and even murder — because it is considered legitimate, necessary, integral to our well-being. This soothing illusion has only 
            been able to persist, however, because of a consistent disregard for those on the receiving end of this violence, for the 
            communities who experience the police not in theory but in practice.<br><br>
        
            For as long as the police has existed, those who are policed have denounced the harassment, humiliation, and abuse perpetrated 
            by law enforcement, as well as their role in destroying people and communities. It has been easy to ignore these voices because 
            the most policed are often the most marginalized, but also because victims of police are made illegitimate by design: since the 
            police only inflict violence on those who deserve it, to be violated by police makes one both deserving of violence and 
            undeserving of a voice, et voilà. <br><br>

            Yet our failure to reckon with the dark sidereality of policing is also caused by the systematic opacity of police departments. 
            In the U.S., there is no concerted governmental effort to keep track of acts of violence committed by police, so if one wanted 
            to see the ‘hard’ science, the numbers that describe police activity — they simply wouldn’t find them. This lack of data is 
            especially disturbing when it comes to civilian deaths caused by police. The Las Vegas Review-Journal writes, "The nation’s 
            leading law enforcement agency [FBI] collects vast amounts of information on crime nationwide, but missing from this clearinghouse 
            are statistics on where, how often, and under what circumstances police use deadly force. In fact, no one anywhere comprehensively 
            tracks the most significant act police can do in the line of duty: take a life.” <br><br>

            To address this situation, journalist and researcher D. Brian Burghart undertook the project of compiling all civilian 
            deaths caused by police in the United States, from Jan. 1st 2000 to today. This dataset, which is freely available on his 
            website fatalencounters.org, is the only comprehensive record of the deaths caused by policing in the United States. This 
            includes “all deaths that happen when police are present or that are caused by police: on-duty, off-duty, criminal, 
            line-of-duty, local, federal, intentional, accidental – all of them.” To be sure, thesethis data consists of more than the 
            murders committed by police officers; it also speaks of the people who die from the consequences of an arrest, those who die 
            during a pursuit, or those who take their lives during a standoff with the police or that die in firefight. All of these 
            lives constitute the death toll of policing, that is, the lives lost because of the presence and operation of the police. 
            Burghart writes, "If this dataset falls short of your expectations in any way, contact your representatives. Local, state and 
            federal agencies don’t require collection of complete data regarding the numbers and characteristics of people their employees 
            kill because they don’t want citizens to have access to transparent and verifiable data. The State’s reasons for this are more 
            opaque.” <br><br>

            In an effort to visualize the death toll of policing in the United States and to explore some of the dynamics that underlie this 
            phenomenon, we draw on data from Fatal Encounters and put themit in conversation with information about the governance of the 
            places where these deaths occur. <br><br></p>

            In recent years, video footage of brutal police murders has forced us all to reckon with the reality of policing, 
            and in recent months millions of people have taken to the streets to demand justice, accountability, and freedom from 
            unjustified police violence. Central to the analysis developed by this movement is an understanding of the role of police 
            in subjugating Black people and maintaining racial hierarchies. This has been true from the very inception of the police, 
            throughout its history, and it remains true today.<br><br>

            The systemic racism of policing becomes apparent when one looks at the data on who dies when interacting with police. 
            Disaggregating police-caused deaths by race reveals three phenomena. First, deaths caused by policing have been increasing 
            consistently over the past 20 years, and this trend is true for Black, Hispanic, and white people indiscriminately. Second, 
            Black and Latino people are losing their lives at the hands of police at higher rates than white people — they are 
            disproportionately affected by the violence of policing, even though they are minorities in the population. Third, these 
            deaths are becoming increasingly skewed towards minorities. These three alarming trends suggest that the police is becoming 
            increasingly aggressive and invested in maintaining the racial order.<br><br></p>

            One of the key demands of the current movement to end police violence is to 'defund the police'. This approach to police 
            reform, shaped by the work of police and prison abolitionists, is in stark contrast with the last century of liberal 
            police reform. Traditionally, police reform has attempted to make the police a fairer institution, but in practice it 
            has consisted in giving more money and often more power to the police. Defunding the police is a reform that intends to 
            reduce the scope and power of the police — while at the same time increasing resources for services that address the 
            social, economic, and political roots of violence and harm, and ensuring universal access to health care, housing, and 
            education. This kind of reform is rooted in the understanding that "the only way to diminish police violence is to reduce 
            contact between the public and the police.” <br><br>

            This understanding, which abolitionists have attained through their experience dealing with the police but also by witnessing 
            decades of failed police reform, is also substantiated by the data. By using data on the size of the police force in seventy 
            U.S. cities, a general trend appears: more police officers per capita correlate with more deaths caused by police per capita. 
            That is, a higher police presence is associated with a higher rate of people killed by policing. It is also relevant to notice 
            that this trend is true for both Democrat- and Republican-run cities, which (if we assume Democrats implement more police reforms 
            than Republicans) indicates that liberal police reform does not counteract this fundamental tendency.<br><br></p>

            Still, it is important to note that police in Democrat-run cities cause less deaths than in Republican cities. Breaking 
            down the data by political party reveals that, on average, Republican cities have had consistently higher rates of 
            police-caused deaths than Democratic cities over the past twenty years. This suggests that liberal reforms are at least 
            more successful, or less damaging, than the Republican approach to law enforcement. A closer look at the twenty most 
            populated Democratic and Republican cities confirms this trend. Police-caused deaths have remained constant or decreased 
            in half of Democratic cities, and they are consistently below the national average; in contrast, police-caused deaths have 
            increased in 17 of the 20 most populated Republican cities, and all but 7 cities are over the national average. In addition, 
            the rates of increase of police-caused deaths have been considerably steeper in Republican cities.<br><br></p>

            The near-stability of the rate of people killed by police in Democratic cities is a success when compared to the increases in 
            Republican cities, but it is a failure in relation to the overall goal of ending the death of civilians at the hands of the 
            police. This data is consistent with critiques of liberal police reform that describe it as a futile cycle: reform is always 
            an aesthetic transformation of the police, whose aim is to renew the legitimacy of the institution after a scandal, while doing 
            nothing to address the oppressive nature of the police. Inevitably, every reform is followed by new scandals, which lead to more 
            reforms, and the cycle repeats. The stagnation of policing death rates in Democratic cities seems to be a perfect representation 
            of this tragic loop. <br><br></p>

            The data above is about the people who have lost their lives because of policing. Although these deaths are some of the 
            most jarring consequences of policing, they are only the tip of the iceberg. Death is one end of a continuum of police 
            violence that includes surveillance and harassment by police patrols, random searches, physical and sexual abuse, arrests, 
            detainment, fines, incarceration, as well as the social, political, economic and psychological toll that policing takes on 
            individuals and communities. Most of this violence is legal, and is simply the result of policing functioning as intended. 
            Unsurprisingly, data about these forms of violence is virtually nonexistent. This, however, does not mean that we lack the 
            means to recognize and address them. Sometimes, grasping reality is as easy as listening to those who have experienced it, 
            and to trust the analyses and solutions they have developed.<br><br>

            Still, the numbers presented in this analysis speak of policing as a site of death and of reproduction of American racial 
            hierarchies; they also speak of the resilience of these features, even in the face of political efforts intent on 
            separating good policing from bad policing. Taken together, these phenomena could be understood through a simple notion: 
            the problem is not that the police is imperfect, the problem is that the police is the police. We should not be thinking 
            of ‘fixing' the institution, but rather of acting towards a society where such an institution is undesired and unnecessary.<br><br>
