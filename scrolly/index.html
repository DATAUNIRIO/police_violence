                Itâ€™s clear that we need to have less police ocers in cities and more essential social workers and people who
                actually know what theyre doing, defund the police !!!!

                    If we rearrange all the data points into a histogram format, the salary potential of engineering majors becomes
                even more stark, as almost all the points on the right of the graph are colored yellow, for engineering. As for all the 
                other majors, they follow a fairly diverse yet tightly spaced distribution, with the modal class being
                salaries between $34,000 and $36,000.

                Police violence has increased alot since 2000, especially in republican cities. See for yourself in the viz below

                    Hopefully, this has helped you in deciding what major you hope to study. If you want to take a deeper look into the data for yourself, you can download
                    all the csv files <a href = 'https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/fivethirtyeight-college-majors-dataset'>here</a>.
